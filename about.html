            Code for Cape Town (Code4CT) is a programme that introduces young girls to basic web building skills and exposes them to
            opportunities in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector. Participants are trained in web development,
            design principles, as well as courses in professional development. Code4CT aims to inspire a generation of young girls who
            are well-prepared with a toolkit of technical and soft skills in order to achieve high impact in the workplace. These are
            skills that everyone should have. Even if you have no intention of becoming a professional coder, you will benefit from knowing
            how to think in this way in this increasingly computerized economy. A growing number of permanent job positions that use
            information technology to deliver a product or a service are becoming available in the local economy. It is estimated that
            nearly 75000 such jobs will come online in South Africa within the next five years. These digital jobs will mostly be driven
            by the ICT, Business Process Outsourcing (BPO), and the financial services industries. These are the fastest growing sectors
            in our economy. They are also the sectors that have the highest demand for entry-level digital skills.

                        Tracy joined the Code4CT program in 2015 and then matriculated from Rustenburg Girls’ High in 2016. She decided to intern
                        with Code4CT to give back to an organisation that had a large impact on her personal growth and development.
                        During her time at Code4CT she facilitated coding classes, headed up the Ambassador programme and assisted
                        with all program operations and logistics. She believes in helping young girls realize the potential they
                        have to become game changers in their local communities.
